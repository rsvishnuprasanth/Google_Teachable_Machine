# 🍎 AI-Powered Fruit Quality Detection: Real-time Classification Using Teachable Machine 🍏  

## 🌟 Overview  
This project focuses on **fruit quality detection** using **Google Teachable Machine**, an AI-based tool for image classification. The model is trained to classify fruits as **"Good" or "Bad"** based on real-time image inputs from a webcam or uploaded images.  

## ✨ Features  
✅ **Real-time classification** of fruits using a trained AI model  
✅ **Uses Google Teachable Machine** for image-based learning  
✅ **Trained on labeled datasets** of fresh and rotten fruits  
✅ **No coding required** – simple model training and deployment  
✅ **Can be integrated into various applications** for automated fruit quality assessment  

## 🔧 Technology Used  
🖥 **Google Teachable Machine** – for training and classification  
🌐 **JavaScript & HTML (Optional)** – for integrating the model into a web-based application  
🤖 **TensorFlow.js (Optional)** – for running the model in a browser  

## 🛠 How It Works  
1️⃣ **Data Collection:** Images of fresh and rotten fruits are collected and labeled.  
2️⃣ **Model Training:** The images are used to train a **Teachable Machine model**, learning to differentiate good and bad fruits.  
3️⃣ **Classification:** When a fruit is shown to the camera, the model predicts and classifies it as **"Good" or "Bad"** in real-time.  
4️⃣ **Integration:** The trained model can be exported and embedded into a web application or other platforms.  

## 🚀 Setup & Usage  
1. Open [Google Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) 🔗  
2. Upload **good and bad fruit images**, label them, and train the model.  
3. Export the trained model and use it in a **web app or Python-based application**.  
4. Run the classification by **showing a fruit** to the camera or uploading an image.
